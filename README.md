# Proposal

 

## What will (likely) be the title of your project? My fist project was going to be called paranoia or anxiety. Then my other project was going to be called YTranscriber. And lastly, my last project was called Dogwatcher2.

 

TODO

 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")1st project: ASCII 1st person game which ended by you dying or surviving while looking at the mirror by some creepy thing if you didn’t follow certain rules that are not explained in game. 2nd project: transcribes YouTube videos using ChatGPT and google cloud. 3rd project: organizes your files.

 

TODO

 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed? File organizer will use an installation called watchdog, which can scan your system for you. It will then organize you files based on their file extension.

 

TODO

 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course? Not applicable

 

TODO, if applicable

 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below. Not applicable

 

TODO, if applicable

 

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what? Good outcome would’ve been that it actually ran.

 

TODO

 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? A better outcome would’ve been being able to create command options, more optional file extensions, make a menu, be able to acquire data from the cloud and internet, be able to automatically come to an agreement with external applications, modify itself in accordance to the computer, etc. I was way too ambitious for the little time I had. I didn’t want to accept it at the time, but what I thought I could accomplish at the time was simply the structure and logic of the program, and being able to run it.

 

TODO

 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline? The best outcome would’ve been not getting cut out from my first project. I hoped to accomplish something great this semester. I was really hoping in impressing my professors and giving it my all. But this has been, by far, my worst semester ever. I hoped to accomplish something that would make me exceptional. Of course though, nothing like that happened, and even worse, I made myself look like an exceptionally horrible student. Im sorry.

 

TODO

 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what? I had to learn a lot and then be able to simplify it into the most of the things we’ve learned in class. I did a ton of research on the best way of doing it and tried my best to take all those ideas and change them into my own original logic and ideas.I was also scared about distorting my files in any way so I was very careful. What I had to learn most was the control on the system and things about a computer’s terminal.
